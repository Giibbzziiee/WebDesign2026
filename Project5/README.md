# Assignment Reflection: Choose Your Own Adventure
## What I Created
I built a space-themed adventure called "Star-Born," where the player controls a pilot named Ethan and his ferret companion, Pip. I focused on creating a scalable architecture by using a JavaScript object to store scene data, allowing the story to be easily expanded.

## What the Generative AI Created
The AI (Gemini) created a Cyberpunk-themed story called "Neon Rain."

Aesthetic: It used a high-contrast "Matrix-esque" style with neon green accents and monospaced terminal fonts.

Logic: It used a switch statement and global variables to track "Credits" and "Reputation."

Features: It included a dynamic status bar that updated as the player made choices.

## Reflection & Comparison
What I liked about the AI version: My favorite thing was definitely the retro feeling. The neon green colors and the "Matrix" vibe were very visually appealing. Even though the AI's code used a different logic structure, it felt very "clean" and functional, much like my own.

What I didn't like / Code Comparison: There wasn't much I didn't like about the AI version, but looking closer at the code, I realized a major difference. The AI hard-coded the story text directly into its functions. While this felt "cleaner" to read for a small project, my own code (using a scenes object) is actually more functional for a larger game because it separates the story data from the display logic.

## Successes
Scalable Data: Successfully implemented a "Data Structure" approach using a constant object to manage story nodes.

DOM Interaction: Successfully linked JavaScript to the HTML to dynamically swap images and button text based on the player's state.

Navigation Logic: Built a functional "Restart" loop so the game can be played multiple times without refreshing the page.

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them
My biggest challenge was the "blank page" feeling. Outside of using console.log for basic debugging, I didn't initially feel like I knew what I was doing with the logic flow. I spent the better half of the week going through the lessons and training myself to be more proficient.

I overcame this by using youtube outside of the lesson plans. Studying more skills than were strictly required for the assignment so that I could feel confident enough to build a webpage that reflected that effort. Throughout that I even learned how to use css and java to make the page more accessible by mobile devices. By breaking the project down into small pieces (first the HTML structure, then the CSS styling, and finally the JS logic), I was able to turn that initial confusion into a fully functional webpage.
