# README.md – AI Recreation Reflection (Star-Born)

## What I Created
- I created a browser-based interactive adventure story game called **Star-Born**.
- It’s a branching narrative game where the player makes decisions through buttons and sometimes typed input.
- My version has an actual player state system:
  - Player name
  - Credits
  - Inventory
  - Reputation
  - Pip’s trust level
- The story has multiple full paths and endings, not just a single win/loss.
- Some scenes use text input for choices, like:
  - Entering your pilot name
  - Typing a hack attempt
  - Writing your purpose
  - Choosing your risk tolerance
- I used DOM manipulation to update everything on the page:
  - story text
  - images
  - buttons
  - input fields
- I also made the game feel like an actual game, not just a JavaScript requirement checklist.

## What Gemini Created
- Gemini created a much simpler version of my game that used typed commands only.
- Instead of buttons and a real branching story, it basically reduced the entire game into:
  - a few scenes
  - a few keywords
  - a win or loss screen
- Gemini’s version also added a “Mission Log” history list, which is kind of cool, but it didn’t make up for the game being simplified.
- It also removed basically everything that made my version feel like a real adventure:
  - no inventory
  - no credits
  - no reputation
  - no Pip trust system
  - no detailed writing
  - no multiple endings based on different outcomes

## How I Feel About Relying Only on AI Output
- If I relied only on Gemini’s output, I would honestly feel like I didn’t make a real project.
- Gemini’s version technically checks boxes, but it does not feel fun.
- It also doesn’t feel like something I would be proud of.
- My version took way longer, but it actually feels like a complete game.
- AI is useful for ideas and debugging, but it is not good at capturing the “point” of the project when the point is creativity.

## Whether I Could Explain the Code That Was Written
- I can explain my code because I rewrote it multiple times and had to fight it into working.
- I understand how my version works because I built:
  - the playerState object
  - the scenes object
  - the showScene() function
  - the dynamic text and input system
- I could explain Gemini’s code, but it wouldn’t feel natural because it’s structured in a very “AI tutorial” way.
- Gemini’s code also feels like it was built around meeting requirements instead of making a good game.

## Whether the Final Work Still Feels Like My Own
- My version 100% feels like my own.
- The writing style is mine, and the tone is mine.
- Pip being a ferret copilot is also very much my sense of humor.
- The choices and pacing are mine.
- Gemini’s version does not feel like my game.
- It feels like a simplified “Star-Born summary” instead of Star-Born.

## Biggest Differences Between My Version and Gemini’s Version
- My version has:
  - deeper writing
  - more scenes
  - more branching
  - actual game stats and progression
  - a better user experience (buttons, story flow, etc.)
- Gemini’s version has:
  - very few scenes
  - keyword input only
  - one win/loss system
  - basically no replay value
  - much less personality
- Gemini also removed almost everything that made my version enjoyable.

## Final Thoughts
- This assignment honestly proved to me that AI can write functional code, but it does not automatically make something good.
- Gemini’s version is not “wrong,” it’s just boring.
- My version took way longer and was way harder, but it actually feels like a game.
- If I used AI only, I would’ve ended up with something that technically works but is not fun or creative.
- I’d rather struggle and make something that feels like mine than submit something that feels like a robot made it.
