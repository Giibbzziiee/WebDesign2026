                <p><strong>Major:</strong> Media Arts</p>
                <p><strong>Expected Graduation:</strong> 05/2026</p>
                
                <h2>Skills & Interests</h2>
                <p>I’m Ethan Gibson, a media arts student with a passion for creating across multiple disciplines.
                   I work with photography, filmmaking, sound design, graphic design, and web development, and 
                   I’m always looking for ways to blend technology with storytelling. I enjoy hands-on projects,
                   whether that means building websites, designing brands, editing video, or experimenting with
                   audio. Outside of digital work, I’m into automotive projects, retro gaming, and creative 
                   entrepreneurship. I’m driven by curiosity, problem-solving, and collaboration, and I’m always
                   pushing to turn ideas into finished experiences that feel personal, expressive, and visually
                   engaging.</p>

                <h2>Sly Cooper 2: Band of Thieves</h2>
                <p><strong>Game Title:</strong> Sly Cooper 2: Band of Thieves</p>
                <p><strong>Platform:</strong> PS2 </p>
                <p><strong>When:</strong> 2004 </p>
                
                <h2>The Memory</h2>
                <p>I think this was one of the very first games I ever played when I really started becoming conscious
                   as a human being. You know, instead of being completely oblivious to the world like most 4 year olds.
                   It's one of my earliest gaming memories, sitting in front of the TV with my older brother trying to
                   steal the mechanical body parts of the games big bad, "Clockwerk."</p>

                <p>I remember being absolutely fascinated by this game. It was probably what really set me on a path
                of generally preferring single player games over multiplayer because the story in this game was just so fun, cheesy,
                and easy to follow when I first played it. I played it again just a couple months back and the games are still just as
                fantastic as they were in my childhood.</p>
