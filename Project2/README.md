#What I created:
I built a personal webpage that focused on clearly presenting who I am, my interests, and a short narrative element. My approach prioritized structure, readability, and meeting the assignment requirements while keeping the design simple and functional.

#What the generative AI/someone else created:
The AI-generated version explored a more stylized and narrative-driven layout, with stronger visual contrast and a more deliberate storytelling structure. It showed alternative design and interaction choices that went beyond my initial approach.

#How I would feel relying only on AI or someone else’s work:
If I relied entirely on AI-generated output or someone else’s work, the project wouldn’t feel as meaningful. Even if the result looked polished, I wouldn’t feel fully connected to it or confident making changes without hesitation.

#Whether I could adequately explain the code that was written:
I can explain the code I wrote myself and understand why each part exists. With AI-generated code, I would need to spend additional time reviewing and learning it before I could confidently explain how everything works.

#Whether the final work still feels like my own:
The final work still feels like my own because the core ideas, goals, and direction came from me. The AI-assisted version functioned as a comparison and learning tool rather than a replacement for my creative process.
